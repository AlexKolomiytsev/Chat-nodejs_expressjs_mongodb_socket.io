# Chat-nodejs_expressjs_mongodb_socket.io
To start Chat,
 - you want to download mongoDB - https://www.mongodb.org/
 - install mongodb
 - After install you will need to create a new folder for your db (for example: mongo/data/db)
 - go to mongo/bin path and type in cmd 'mongod --dbpath="path to your db"'. 
    Now your db server is started, and you may start the Chat app =)
